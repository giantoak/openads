#OpenAds

This is the Giant Oak development branch of the OpenAds project. It will focus on these two broadly conceived functionalities:

* A view for controlling the display of ad market size of particular cities based on control variables (like population and crime)

* A view for displaying major events on the timeline, to aid in the performance of difference-in-difference comparisons
